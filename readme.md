# Kita

The best local search app for your mac

## Roadmap

- ability to switch to other apps by searching
- embedding db/ RAG pipeline
- real time mode to handle new files
- customizable hot key
- everything has to be very very fast

// TODO: update how we get the icons for applications
// TODO: update how we cache the apps, instead of re-doing the cache ever 5 seconds, since the apps don't change often
// we should just store them in the sqlite db or even better, in an in-memory map in the app handler class, along with their AppInfo
