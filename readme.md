# Kita

The best local search app for your mac

## Roadmap

- embedding db/ RAG pipeline
- real time mode to handle new files
- customizable hot key
- everything has to be very very fast

// TODO: create a new channel to stream resource usage updates to the UI and decouple from the app search since right now, the resource usage doesn't update unless you update the search
